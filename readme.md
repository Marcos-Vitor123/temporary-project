# Temporary Projects

They are projects of ideas that arise at any time of day to day and in order not to fall into oblivion, I decided to start this project. Each of them will be in separate folders. And its functionalities can be used in future developments of other projects or even can be transferred entirely to an independent project, if the idea is relevant.
